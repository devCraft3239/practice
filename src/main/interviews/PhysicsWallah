Q1: Given a zero-indexed array H of height of buildings, number of bricks b and number of ropes r. You start your journey from buiding 0 and move to adjacent building either using rope or bricks. You have limited number of bricks and ropes.
While moving from ith building to (i+1)th building,
- If next building's height is less than or equal to the current buiding's height, you do not need rope or bricks.
- If next building's height is greater than current buiding's height, you can either use one rope or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
So, question is How far can you reach from 0th buiding if you use bricks and ropes optimally? return index of building till which you can move."
