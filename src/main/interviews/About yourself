Q- Tell me about a time when you faced a problem with a project. How did you solve it?
	- merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			merchant-analytics was taking too much time to ingestion pipeline.
		- choice/action:
			- I've analysed the problem and found that we are using ES for search and analytics both.
			- Set elasticsearch refresh interval to 10 min.
			- I've proposed to use spark for analytics and ES for search only(no agg/computation on elasticsearch).
			- I've implemented the same and it was working fine.
		- outcome:
			- we were able to reduce ingestion time from 2 hours to 30 mins.

	- merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			merchant-analytics query was having high latency.
		- choice/action:
			- I've analysed the documents modeling and optimised to use keyword type for aggregation fields.
		- outcome:
			- we were able to reduce query latency from 2 minutes to 30 secs.
			- we were able to reduce ES cost from 32TB to 23TB.

	- merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			High latency for customer analytics query.
		- choice/action:
			- Database partitioning/sharding
				sharded mid_custid_master[3TB] table on mids.
				- mid_custid_master_0, mid_custid_master_1, mid_custid_master_2, mid_custid_master_3, mid_custid_master_4, mid_custid_master_5, mid_custid_master_6, mid_custid_master_7, mid_custid_master_8, mid_custid_master_9
				- use field type as keyword for aggregation fields
		- outcome:
			- we were able to reduce query latency from 2 minutes to 30 secs.
			- we were able to reduce ES cost from 32TB to 23TB.


Feedback for improvement area from manager:
	- take initiative to monitor junior dev.
	- buffer time for sudden failure scenario

Q- Tell us about a time when you disagreed with your superior.
	- merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			- Need to calculate mid based lat/long and ingest it into KYB team db.
		- choice/action:
			- Proposed to calculate it at our end but not to ingest it into KYB team db.
			- Rather used s3 bucket to store it.
			- KYB team can use it via api call or ingest it according to their need.
		- outcome:
			- loosely couple two systems.

Q- ever refuse rude client(product-manager) requirement?
	- Merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			- requirement to apply transformation on transactional data before ingestion.
		- choice/action:
			- refused to apply transformation on transactional data before ingestion as might be useful for other team.
			- proposed to apply transformation on API side while query.
			- proposed to apply transformation on aggregated data after ingestion.
		- outcome:
			- maintain the data integrity b/w PG and analytics.
			- other system are able to consume the data.

		- situation:
			- Need to calculate mid based lat/long and ingest it into KYB team db.
		- choice/action:
			- Proposed to calculate it at our end but not to ingest it into KYB team db.
			- Rather used s3 bucket to store it.
			- KYB team can use it via api call or ingest it according to their need.

			- loosely couple two systems.


Q- ever had conflict with peer? how did you handle it.
	- merchant-analytics
        - situation:
            - Need to calculate mid based lat/long and ingest it into KYB team db.
        - choice/action:
            - Proposed to calculate it at our end but not to ingest it into KYB team db.
            - Rather used s3 bucket to store it.

        - outcome:
            - loosely couple two systems.

Q- any scenario where you feel you have failed?
	situation:
		- subscription-engine query data from ES analytics with very high TPS.
	choice/action:
		- modified the existing indices to query data but didn't meet the TPS
		- designed new indices to query data with less aggregation fields.
	- outcome:
		- we were able to meet the TPS.
	- lesson learned:
		- consider all the scenario and dependencies before designing the indices.
		- take some buffer time for sudden failure scenario.
		- get the things done first (nothing is perfect).


Q- Have you ever get negative feedback from your boss? How did you handle it?
	situation:
		- having such experience not monitoring junior dev.
	choice/action:
		- started monitoring junior dev.
		- started taking initiative to monitor junior dev.
	- outcome:
		- got positive feedback from manager.
		- learn how to deal a team

Q- Tell me about a mistake you made while working as a software developer. How did you handle it?
	- situation:

		- integration was pending but with other task it went live
			- which to to corrupted data for around 5 days
	- choice/action:
		- I made changes and write new data to newly version_2 s3 bucket
		- at night within 2 hours I wrote historical job for data insertion and ingest historic data for new version for entire may.
		- then I inform my manager about this he said if data is corrected then no issues.
	- outcome:
		- data was corrected and no issues from client side.
		- manager was happy with the way I handled the situation.


Q- What is your greatest accomplishment?
