Multithreading concepts:
- Thread
- Runnable -> does not return anything
	class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
		public void run() {
			// code
		}
	}

	class MyThread extends Thread {
		public void run() {
			// code
		}
	}

	main() {
		MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
		Thread t = new Thread(r);
		Tread t1 = new MyThread();
		t.start();
		t1.start();
	}

- ExecutorService
   class ExecutorServiceExample {
   	public static void main(String[] args) {
   	    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
   	        Runnable worker = new MyThread("Thread" + i);
   	        executor.execute(worker);
   	      }

   	}
   }

- Callable -> return value and throws exception
- Future -> result of a asynchronous computation
- CompletableFuture -> advanced version of Future that can be used to chain multiple asynchronous operations together
