Find missing and repeating number in an array:-
1-10  1-N
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,,7,8,9………N-1]


[2,5,4,3,2]
[0,1,2,3,4]

[2,-5,4,-3,-2]
[0,1,2,3,4]

i=0
i=1, key=4
i=3 key=3
i=4 key = 1
Rep =  2

Missing = 
O(N)
O(1)


List<Integer> findMissingRep(int[] arr){
	Int rep = 0, miss =  0;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		Int key = Math.abs(arr[i])-1;
	if(arr[key] < 0)
		Rep =  key+1;
	arr[key] = arr[key]  *  -1;
}



for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	
}
}
