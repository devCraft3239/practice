load-balancing: evenly distributing/balancing load across n servers

prob: add/remove more servers
	the overall change should be min
	(whenever there is a new server added it takes small parts from each existing and the whole hashing must not change)


consistence-hashing:
	we hash (using uniform hash which uniformly distribute server) server also within the same range as key lets say [0....M-1]
	use multiple(K) hash function to create replica server(k map point for each server) on the circle

	- reduce remapping number of keys to server (only req point to next server will be remapped)
	- reduce uneven distribution of keys (replication of servers in circle)
