s/w Process:
	feature requirement
	Development
	Testing
	Deployment

Developer-machine
	- Application code
	- Framework
	- dependencies (DB mySQL 5.6)
	- OS level lib (ubuntu)

Tester-machine
	- Application code
	- Framework
	- dependency (DB mySQL 7.0)
	- OS level lib (windows)

prob: application working fine on developer machine but not on tester machine [mySQL version 5.6 + ubuntu lib]
sol: don't give only s/w but provide complete image/container(code+framework+dependencies+lib)
note: container don't install new OS like hyperwiser/VMs
ex:
	OS1,OS2,OS3                         App1,App2,App3
	Hyperwiser                            Docker
		OS                                  OS
	 Hardware                           Hardware
