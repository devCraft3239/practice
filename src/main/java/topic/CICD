Water-fall: full feature delivery, deliver as a whole
Agile: Incremental development and delivery

version-control: maintain diff version of the source code.
continuous-integration: don't wait for integrate all the things as whole(let's say sprint end), continuously integrate small changes
	compile, validate, code-review, unit-testing, integration testing, automation-testing ex: jenkins
continuous-delivery: continuously making it available for deployment(let's say not production but mock servers) -> manual deployment
continuous-deployment: commit code -> unit/automation test -> deploy on production

Jenkins: open-source
CI/CD tool written in java
ex:
	job1: git checkout branch, mvn install, mvn test --integration, -> .jar -> put to s3 location
	job2: pick jar -> up docker mock container -> deploy to mock servers
	job3:(manual) deploy image to production servers
