ReST: Representational State Transfer
	- define contract of representation format of state(of data) which is agreed b/w client n server
	- define guidelines how client n server exchange representation state of data

guidelines:
	- client-server
	- cacheable : define if cacheable or not
	- stateless: doesn't know about the request/response state
	- layered: know about immediate layer only
	- uniform-interface: all API should follow uniform interface like not one API is implemented on Http and another in SMTP
		and for same type of resource, diff url/uri used
	- code on demand:

REST:
	GET     URI         data
	POST    URI         payload         response
	PUT     URI         payload         response
	DELETE  URI                         response

Note:
	state transfer (refer to the state of data)
	stateless (server should not know about client, should follow all request as same no discrimination)

Http response code:
	2xx - success
	3xx - redirection
	4xx - client side error
	5xx - server side error
