Nifi: stream data-flow management tool,
	it define how to will flow b/w systems
flowFile:(abstraction of data) actual data -> csv,json,plainText, sqlQuery etc.
	- content:
	- attribute(meta-data):
processor: atomic element of nifi that can do specific atomic task.
	processor work-on/process flowFile and generate new flowFile
	ex: getFile processor, putFile processor
connection: processor are connected via connection, each connection act as queue b/w processor and contain flowFiles.
back-pressure: threshold for processor to stop producing flowFiles
process-group: collection of processor working together to perform complete data-flow.

input-output port or process-group-connection: we can connect two process-group using input/output port of nifi.
funnel: used to connect multiple processor without input/output port. input-output port can connect two parallel processor-group only.

processor configuration:
connection-queue: each connection acts as a queue for flowFiles
expression-language: ${flowFile_attribute}
nifi-template: snapshot of a processor group, moving processor group on one evn(dev) to another(test/stage)

4V's
Volume — At what scale do you operate? In order of magnitude, are you closer to a few GigaBytes or hundreds of PetaBytes?
Variety — How many data sources do you have? Are your data structured? If yes, does the schema vary often?
Velocity — What is the frequency of the events you process? Is it credit cards payments? Is it a daily performance report sent by an IoT device?
Veracity — Can you trust the data? Alternatively, do you need to apply multiple cleaning operations before manipulating it?
