Aws-lambda: server-less computing power

similar:
	EC2(Elastic Cloud Compute):(high flexibility) server provision only, need security, auto-scaling, load balancer,
	ECS(Elastic Container Store):(mid flexibility and complexity) Docker-eco-system, cluster(EC2 servers) + tasks(application, bulk request)/images
		images are stored in Elastic Container Repository and enable as tasks.
	lambda:(no complexity, pay as per use) Function/code

server-less:
  Run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Simply write and upload code as a .zip file or container image.
auto-scale:
  Automatically respond to code execution requests at any scale, from a dozen events per day to hundreds of thousands per second.
cost-per-use(100ms):
  Save costs by paying only for the compute time you use—by per-millisecond—instead of provisioning infrastructure upfront for peak capacity.
execution-optimised:
  Respond to high demand in double-digit milliseconds with Provisioned Concurrency.
  Optimize code execution time and performance with the right function memory size.

use-cases:
  cron-expression/schedule-events [cron(), rate()]
  events
	  file-processing [upload file to s3]
	  db-update [update premium merchant]
      mobile-backend [status update]
  static web application [weather update]
  stream-processing [social media tag etc]
