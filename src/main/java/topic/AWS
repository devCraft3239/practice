CPU vs vCPU:
	Amazon EC2 instances support multithreading, which enables multiple threads to run concurrently on a single CPU core.
	Each thread is represented as a virtual CPU (vCPU) on the instance.
	An instance has a default number of CPU cores, which varies according to instance type.
	For example, an m5.xlarge instance type has two CPU cores and two threads per core by defaultâ€”four vCPUs in total.
